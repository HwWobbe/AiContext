# AiContext

> A personal toolkit for working smarter with AI — structured context, dense stamps, and portable session state.

---

## What Is This Repo?

AI conversations are stateless. Every new session starts blank.  
**AiContext** is a collection of tools and documents that solve that problem — capturing, compressing, and injecting context so AI picks up exactly where you left off.

The philosophy: **denser is better**. A well-structured JSON stamp beats a wall of prose every time.

---

## Projects

### [`ContextLatticeStamp/`](ContextLatticeStamp/README.md)
The core system. Build versioned JSON stamps of your working context, inject them into any AI chat via hotkey, and maintain continuity across sessions.

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Docs & guides | `ContextLatticeStamp/Docs/` |
| Scripts (Python + AHK) | `ContextLatticeStamp/Scripts/` |
| Example stamps | `ContextLatticeStamp/Examples/` |
| Design essay | `ContextLatticeStamp/Essay/` |

---

## Repo Conventions

**Naming:** PascalCase for all directories and documents.  
**Private data:** Files prefixed `RnHw_` are personal/local only — never committed. Excluded via `.gitignore`.  
**Versioning:** Long-form drafts use `_vX.Y` suffix (e.g. `DenserIsBetter_v0.1.md`).

See [`ContextLatticeStamp/Docs/FolderStructureGuide.md`](ContextLatticeStamp/Docs/FolderStructureGuide.md) for the full layout and decision rules.

---

## What's Not Here

| Excluded | Reason |
|---|---|
| `RnHw_*.json` | Personal vocabulary & private data dictionaries — local only |
| Session logs | Transient; not versioned |

---

## Status

Active personal project. Structure is stable; tooling and documentation are expanding.

# ContextLatticeStamp

> **Dense, portable context for AI conversations — stamp once, carry everywhere.**

---

## What Is This?

ContextLatticeStamp is a lightweight system for capturing, storing, and injecting structured context into AI sessions. Instead of re-explaining your project, preferences, and vocabulary every conversation, you *stamp* a JSON snapshot and paste it in. The AI picks up exactly where you left off.

The core idea: **denser is better**. A well-compressed stamp beats a wall of prose every time.

---

## Quick Overview

| Layer | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Stamp** | A JSON snapshot of your current context (project state, vocab, goals) |
| **Lattice** | The schema that keeps stamps consistent and parseable |
| **Manager** | `RnhwJsonManager.py` — build, validate, and version your stamps |
| **Jump** | `Jump.ahk` — hotkey launcher to inject stamps into any AI chat |

---

## Getting Started

See [`Docs/QuickStart.md`](Docs/QuickStart.md) for setup in under 10 minutes.

---

## Key Concepts

**Stamp** — A versioned JSON object. Contains project metadata, vocabulary mappings, session goals, and any persistent context the AI needs to orient itself immediately.

**Lattice** — The structural schema stamps conform to. Keeps them machine-readable and diff-friendly across versions.

**RnHw prefix** — Internal namespace for personal data files (e.g. `RnHw_DataDict.json`). These are excluded from the repo by `.gitignore` and stay private.

---

## What's Not in This Repo

| Item | Why excluded |
|---|---|
| `RnHw_DataDict.json` | Contains personal vocabulary & private mappings |
| Any `RnHw_*.json` | All personal data dictionaries stay local |

---

## Essay

[*Denser Is Better*](Essay/DenserIsBetter_v0.1.md) — the case for high-density context injection over verbose re-explanation. Short read, worth it.

---

## Status

Early release. Schema and tooling are functional; documentation is actively expanding.

# RnHw: contextLatticeStamp Quick Start Guide

**Version:** 0.2.2  
**Date:** 2026-02-23  
**Status:** Living Document

---

## TL;DR - What You Have

A multi-dimensional note navigation system with:
- **450K notes** (goal) indexed by contextLatticeStamps
- **7 lanes** (𝒞𝒯𝒦𝒮ℱ𝒢𝒟) for different content types
- **3 input methods** (TextBlaze, AHK, PowerShell)
- **Lattice structure** (QrSt) for multi-axis organization

---

## Decision Tree: Which Tool When?

```
┌─ At Desktop? 
│  └─ YES → Use Win+J (fastest, no paste)
│  └─ NO → Continue ↓
│
┌─ In Text Field? (email, chat, doc)
│  └─ YES → Use /jt or /jump (TextBlaze)
│  └─ NO → Continue ↓
│
┌─ In AI Chat?
│  └─ YES → Use /f key (minimal tokens)
│  └─ NO → Continue ↓
│
└─ Batch Operations? (10+ notes)
   └─ YES → Use PowerShell scripts
```

**Rule:** Pick ONE primary per context. Ignore others until muscle memory forms.

---

## 5 Core Operations

### 1. **Jump to Note** (most common)

**Desktop:** `Win+J` → type lane → type key → Enter  
**Text field:** `/jt TagVocabulary` → paste in terminal  
**AI chat:** `/f TagVocabulary` → click URL

### 2. **Register New Note**

**PowerShell:**
```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import register_note; print(register_note('tw', '𝕯', 'URL', 'Title', manual_key='Key'))"
```

**TextBlaze:** `/reg` → fill form → paste command

### 3. **Insert Timestamp**

**TextBlaze:** `/now` → select options → inserts stamp  
**Result:** `ℌ🐟午㋁⑧㏵♅㏜㍩`

### 4. **Search Notes**

**PowerShell:**
```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import find_notes; [print(n['key']) for n in find_notes(prefix='𝕯')]"
```

### 5. **List All Notes in Lane**

**PowerShell:**
```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import list_notes; list_notes(lane='tw')"
```

---

## Typography System (Lane/Category/Topic)

### **Lanes** (Script font) - Site/System Identifiers

```
𝒞 = Claude conversations
𝒯 = TiddlyWiki
𝒦 = Google Keep
𝒮 = SQL Server/database
ℱ = File system
𝒢 = GitHub/repos
𝒟 = Google Docs
```

### **Categories** (Fraktur font) - Organizational Groupings

```
𝕬 𝕭 𝕮 𝕯 𝕰 𝕱 𝕲 ℌ 𝕴 𝕵 𝕶 𝕷 𝕸 𝕹 𝕺 𝕻 𝕼 𝕽 𝕾 𝕿 𝖀 𝖁 𝖂 𝖃 𝖄 𝖅

Reserved for future use - will emerge from usage patterns
Examples: Active/Archive, Personal/Shared, Concept/Procedure
```

### **Topics** (Blackboard bold) - Subject Domains

```
𝕯      = Design (single char)
𝕽𝕯     = Redis (multi-char)
𝕰𝖘     = Essay
𝕷𝖆𝖙    = Lattice
noTopic = Uncategorized (plain text)
```

---

## Bootstrap Strategy (Getting to 450K)

### **Week 1-4: Opportunistic (Goal: 20 notes)**

**Method:** Stamp notes as you access them
- Open TW tiddler → Test `Win+J` to see if registered
- If not found → register via `/reg` or PowerShell
- Track friction points

**Learn:** What gets accessed? What's hard to stamp?

### **Month 2: First Batch (Goal: 100 notes)**

**Method:** Bulk-stamp one topic cluster
- Export all tiddlers tagged "Design"
- Generate stamps from creation dates
- Review/adjust manually

**Learn:** What rules work? What patterns emerge?

### **Month 3+: Systematic (Goal: 1000+ notes)**

**Method:** Define categories, batch migrate
- Review patterns from 100+ notes
- Define 3-5 categories that matter
- Build migration scripts

**Learn:** What scales? What breaks?

---

## Scale Migration Triggers

### **When to Migrate from JSON → SQLite:**

**Trigger 1: Performance**
- JSON file >5MB (~5,000 notes)
- Lookup time >100ms
- Complex queries needed

**Trigger 2: Features**
- Need relational queries (joins)
- Want full-text search across content
- Analytics/reporting required

### **When to Split TW into Tiers:**

**Trigger: TW has >10,000 tiddlers**

**3-Tier Architecture:**
```
Tier 1: HOT (TiddlyWiki)
  └─ Active working notes (last 3 months, top 1000)
  └─ ~5,000-10,000 tiddlers

Tier 2: WARM (SQLite)
  └─ Searchable archive (6mo-5yr old)
  └─ ~100,000-400,000 notes

Tier 3: COLD (Git/Filesystem)
  └─ Long-term archive (>5yr, rarely accessed)
  └─ Unlimited capacity
```

---

## Current System Specs

### **Files:**
- `C:\Users\hwobb\RnHw\rnhw_json_manager.py` - v0.2.2
- `C:\Users\hwobb\RnHw\RnHw_DataDict.json` - main data store
- `C:\Users\hwobb\RnHw\jump.ahk` - Win+J hotkey

### **Registered Notes:** 2
- `RnHw:𝒯:TagVocabulary` - Design:TagVocabulary tiddler
- `RnHw:𝒯:noTopic一` - SetAnchor tiddler

### **Exec Templates:** 3
- `jump_tw` - Jump to TW tiddler by name
- `jump_note` - Jump via DataDict lookup
- `register_tw_batch` - Batch register tiddlers

---

## Common Patterns

### **Register Current TW Tiddler:**

1. Open tiddler in TW
2. Copy URL from address bar (with permalinks enabled)
3. PowerShell:
```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import register_note; print(register_note('tw', 'TOPIC', 'URL', 'TITLE', manual_key='KEY'))"
```

### **Find All Notes in Topic:**

```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import find_notes; [print(f\"{n['key']}: {n['title']}\") for n in find_notes(prefix='𝕯')]"
```

### **Jump Workflow:**

```
Win+J → tw → TagVocabulary → Opens tiddler
Win+J → convo → 𝕮𝕷𝕾Main → Opens conversation
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### **Win+J doesn't work:**
- Check AHK is running (tray icon)
- Restart jump.ahk
- Check file path in script matches actual location

### **TW permalinks not showing:**
- TW Settings → Navigation → "Include the target tiddler"
- Reload TW

### **Python import errors:**
- `cd C:\Users\hwobb\RnHw` first
- Check file exists: `dir rnhw_json_manager.py`

### **TextBlaze snippets not expanding:**
- Check subscription status
- Verify snippet is saved
- Try in different app to test

---

## Next Steps

### **This Week:**
1. ✓ Understand tool choice (this doc)
2. Register 10 more notes opportunistically
3. Pick ONE primary jump method, use exclusively

### **This Month:**
1. Define first batch-stamp target (Design notes?)
2. Build stamping rules (date → time dimension)
3. Reach 100 registered notes

### **This Quarter:**
1. Migrate to SQLite when JSON >5MB
2. Define 3-5 categories from patterns
3. Build TW AutoComplete integration (optional)

# ContextLatticeStamp — Folder Structure Guide

*Where things go, and why.*

---

## The Rule of Thumb

> **If it explains → `Docs/`  
> If it runs → `Scripts/`  
> If it demonstrates → `Examples/`  
> If it argues → `Essay/`**

---

## Top-Level: `AiContext/`

The root repo. Each subdirectory is a self-contained project within the broader AI-context tooling ecosystem.

```
AiContext/
├── README.md                  ← Repo overview & index of projects
├── .gitignore                 ← Repo-wide exclusions (RnHw_*.json, etc.)
└── ContextLatticeStamp/       ← This project
    └── ...
```

**Adding a new project?** Create a new top-level folder (CamelCase), give it its own `README.md`, and link it from `AiContext/README.md`.

---

## `ContextLatticeStamp/`

### `Docs/`
Human-readable documentation. Anything a new user or your future self needs to understand and use the system.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `QuickStart.md` | Minimal setup → first working stamp in <10 min |
| `Architecture.md` | Schema design, lattice spec, versioning rules |
| `StampingGuide.md` | Step-by-step: building, editing, injecting stamps |
| `Faq.md` | Troubleshooting & common questions |

**Add here when:** you're writing an explanation, a how-to, a reference, or a decision log.  
**Don't add here:** runnable code, raw data, personal configs.

---

### `Scripts/`
Everything that *runs*. Python utilities, AutoHotKey scripts, shell scripts.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `RnhwJsonManager.py` | Build, validate, diff, and version stamps |
| `Jump.ahk` | Hotkey launcher — injects a stamp into the active chat window |

**Add here when:** it's executable and meant to be run directly.  
**Naming:** PascalCase for the script name (e.g. `StampValidator.py`). The `Rnhw` prefix is reserved for scripts that touch personal data dictionaries.  
**Don't add here:** `RnHw_*.json` data files — those stay local and out of the repo.

---

### `Examples/`
Reference material — stamps and configs people can clone and adapt.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SampleStamps.json` | Annotated example stamps covering common use-cases |

**Add here when:** you have a concrete, working example worth sharing.  
**Keep sanitized:** no personal vocabulary, no real project names, no private data.

---

### `Essay/`
Long-form writing — philosophy, rationale, and design thinking.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DenserIsBetter_v0.1.md` | The core argument for high-density context injection |

**Naming convention:** `TitleInCamelCase_vX.Y.md` — version in the filename so drafts coexist cleanly.  
**Add here when:** it's an argument or exploration, not a how-to. If it's instructional, it belongs in `Docs/`.

---

## Naming Conventions (Summary)

| Thing | Convention | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Directories | PascalCase | `ContextLatticeStamp/`, `Examples/` |
| Markdown docs | PascalCase | `QuickStart.md`, `StampingGuide.md` |
| Python scripts | PascalCase | `RnhwJsonManager.py` |
| AHK scripts | PascalCase | `Jump.ahk` |
| Personal data files | `RnHw_` prefix + PascalCase | `RnHw_DataDict.json` |
| Versioned drafts | `_vX.Y` suffix | `DenserIsBetter_v0.1.md` |

---

## What Stays Out of the Repo

| Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `RnHw_*.json` | Personal vocabulary & private mappings — local only |
| Any file with real names, IDs, or private project details | Keep examples sanitized |
| Editor config, OS files | Covered by `.gitignore` |

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
New file to add?
│
├── Does it explain or document something?
│   └── → Docs/
│
├── Does it run / execute?
│   └── → Scripts/
│
├── Is it a clean, shareable example?
│   └── → Examples/
│
├── Is it a long-form argument or essay?
│   └── → Essay/
│
└── Is it personal/private data?

# Git Setup Guide: Local ↔ GitHub

**Goal:** `C:\Users\hwobb\GitHub\AiContext\` on your PC stays in sync with `github.com/HwWobbe/AiContext`

---

## Step 1: Install GitHub Desktop

1. Download from https://desktop.github.com
2. Install and sign in with your GitHub account
3. Authorize it when prompted

---

## Step 2: Clone the Repo to Local

1. In GitHub Desktop → **File → Clone Repository**
2. Choose the **GitHub.com** tab
3. Find `HwWobbe/AiContext` in the list
4. Set **Local Path** to:
   ```
   C:\Users\hwobb\GitHub\AiContext
   ```
   (GitHub Desktop will create the `AiContext` folder for you)
5. Click **Clone**

Your repo is now local. Any files in it are visible in File Explorer.

---

## Step 3: Add Your Files

Copy the files from your Claude downloads into the repo folder:

```
C:\Users\hwobb\GitHub\AiContext\
├── README.md                          ← from downloads
├── .gitignore                         ← from downloads
└── ContextLatticeStamp\
    ├── README.md                      ← from downloads
    └── Docs\
        ├── QuickStart.md              ← from downloads
        └── FolderStructureGuide.md    ← from downloads
```

---

## Step 5: Commit and Push

In GitHub Desktop:

1. You'll see all new files listed on the left under **Changes**
2. At the bottom left, type a commit message:
   ```
   Initial structure: README, QuickStart, FolderStructureGuide
   ```
3. Click **Commit to main**
4. Click **Push origin** (top bar)

Files are now live at `github.com/HwWobbe/AiContext`.

---

## Day-to-Day Workflow

| Action | What to do |
|---|---|
| Edit a file locally | Open in VS Code, edit, save |
| Save changes to GitHub | GitHub Desktop → write message → Commit → Push |
| Check what changed | GitHub Desktop shows a diff of every edit |
| Get changes from another machine | GitHub Desktop → **Fetch origin** → **Pull** |

---

## Viewing .md Files

### Recommended: VS Code (Desktop)
Download from https://code.visualstudio.com — free, open source, no account needed.

- Open any `.md` file → press `Ctrl+Shift+V` to toggle rendered preview
- Or press `Ctrl+K V` to open preview side-by-side with the raw text
- VS Code also has Git built in — you can commit and push without leaving the editor

### On GitHub (no install)
Once pushed, `github.com/HwWobbe/AiContext` renders all `.md` files automatically.  
Press `.` (period) on any GitHub repo page to open a browser-based VS Code with full markdown preview — no install required.

### Why not Typora?
Typora is closed source and phones home for license checks. VS Code is the better choice — open source, more capable, and free.

---

## Folder Path Summary

| Location | Path |
|---|---|
| Local repo | `C:\Users\hwobb\GitHub\AiContext\` |
| GitHub repo | `https://github.com/HwWobbe/AiContext` |
| Private data (never synced) | `C:\Users\hwobb\RnHw\RnHw_*.json` |

---

## If You Hit Problems

**"Repository already exists"** → Choose a different folder name or delete the empty local folder first.

**Files not showing in GitHub Desktop** → Make sure you copied files *inside* the cloned folder, not alongside it.

# ContextLatticeStamp — Stamping Guide

**Version:** 0.1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-23
**Status:** Living Document
**Assumes:** QuickStart.md has been read

---

## 1. What Is a Stamp?

A stamp is a versioned JSON object that uniquely identifies and locates a note. It contains enough information to:

- **Find** the note (URL or path)
- **Identify** it (title, lane, category, topic)
- **Place** it in the lattice (key structure)
- **Track** it over time (version, date)

A stamp is not the note itself — it is a lightweight pointer to it.

---

## 2. Key Naming Conventions

The key is the most important part of a stamp. It must be unique, readable, and parseable.

### Structure

```
RnHw:{Lane}:{Category}{Topic}{Qualifier}
```

### Examples

```
RnHw:𝒯:TagVocabulary          ← Lane only, no category/topic
RnHw:𝒯:𝕯TagVocabulary         ← Lane + Topic
RnHw:𝒞:𝕮𝕷𝕾Main               ← Lane + Category + Topic
RnHw:𝒢:𝒢AiContextReadme       ← GitHub lane, repo+file
```

### Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Always start with `RnHw:` | Namespace prefix — never omit |
| Lane is always second | Single script-font character (𝒞𝒯𝒦𝒮ℱ𝒢𝒟) |
| Category is optional | Fraktur font — omit if not yet defined |
| Topic follows category | Blackboard bold, or plain text if no topic |
| Qualifier is optional | Disambiguates when topic alone isn't unique |
| No spaces anywhere | Use CamelCase to separate words |
| Keys are case-sensitive | `TagVocabulary` ≠ `tagvocabulary` |

### When Topic Is Unknown

Use `noTopic` followed by a sequence character:

```
RnHw:𝒯:noTopic一
RnHw:𝒯:noTopic二
```

These are placeholders — update the key when the topic becomes clear.

---

## 3. JSON Stamp Structure

### Minimal Stamp

```json
{
  "key": "RnHw:𝒯:TagVocabulary",
  "lane": "tw",
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/#TagVocabulary",
  "title": "TagVocabulary"
}
```

### Full Stamp

```json
{
  "key": "RnHw:𝒯:𝕯TagVocabulary",
  "lane": "tw",
  "category": "𝕯",
  "topic": "TagVocabulary",
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/#TagVocabulary",
  "title": "Design: TagVocabulary",
  "version": "1.0",
  "created": "2026-02-23",
  "tags": ["design", "vocabulary", "reference"],
  "notes": "Core tag taxonomy for TW"
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `key` | ✅ | Unique identifier — see Section 2 |
| `lane` | ✅ | Short lane code (`tw`, `convo`, `keep`, etc.) |
| `url` | ✅ | Full URL or file path to the note |
| `title` | ✅ | Human-readable name |
| `category` | ○ | Fraktur character — add when known |
| `topic` | ○ | Blackboard bold or plain text |
| `version` | ○ | Stamp version, not note version |
| `created` | ○ | ISO date `YYYY-MM-DD` |
| `tags` | ○ | Free-form array for search |
| `notes` | ○ | One-line context note |

---

## 4. How to Choose a Lane

Lanes identify **where** the note lives — the system or platform.

```
𝒞  tw       → TiddlyWiki
𝒯  convo    → Claude conversations
𝒦  keep     → Google Keep
𝒮  sql      → SQL Server / database
ℱ  fs       → File system
𝒢  gh       → GitHub / repos
𝒟  docs     → Google Docs
```

**Rule:** One note, one lane. If a note exists in two systems, create two stamps with different lane codes.

---

## 5. How to Choose a Category

Categories are **organizational groupings** — they emerge from usage, not from planning.

**Do not pre-define categories.** Register notes with no category first, then assign categories once patterns become visible (typically after 50-100 notes).

When you do assign a category, pick a Fraktur character that feels semantically distinct to you. There is no fixed mapping yet — this will evolve.

**Early guidance:**
- Keep categories broad (Active/Archive, Personal/Shared, Concept/Procedure)
- Aim for 3-7 categories maximum
- A note with no obvious category stays `noTopic` — that is fine

---

## 6. How to Choose a Topic

Topics identify **what** the note is about — the subject domain.

```
𝕯        = Design
𝕽𝕯       = Redis
𝕰𝖘       = Essay
𝕷𝖆𝖙      = Lattice
noTopic  = Uncategorized
```

**Single-char topics** are for broad domains. **Multi-char topics** are for specific systems or projects.

**Rule:** If you hesitate more than 5 seconds choosing a topic — use `noTopic`. Assign later when the pattern is clearer.

---

## 7. When to Create a New Stamp vs. Update Existing

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Note moved to new URL | Update `url` field, keep same key |
| Note renamed | Update `title`, keep same key |
| Topic becomes clear | Update `key`, `topic`, `category` |
| Note split into two | Create second stamp with new key |
| Note deleted | Remove stamp from DataDict |
| New version of same note | Increment `version` field |

**Key stability rule:** Once a key is used in a workflow or script, avoid changing it. Update other fields first. Only rename the key if the old name is genuinely misleading.

---

## 8. Registering a Stamp

### Via PowerShell

```bash
python -c "from rnhw_json_manager import register_note; print(register_note('tw', '𝕯', 'http://localhost:8080/#TagVocabulary', 'TagVocabulary', manual_key='RnHw:𝒯:𝕯TagVocabulary'))"
```

### Via TextBlaze

`/reg` → fill in the form fields → paste the generated command into PowerShell

### Checklist Before Registering

- [ ] URL is correct and working
- [ ] Lane code matches the platform
- [ ] Key follows `RnHw:{Lane}:{Topic}` format
- [ ] No spaces in key
- [ ] Title is human-readable

---

## 9. Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| Spaces in key | Use CamelCase — `TagVocabulary` not `Tag Vocabulary` |
| Wrong lane code | Check lane table in Section 4 |
| Duplicate key | Check DataDict before registering |
| Over-planning categories | Register first, categorize later |
| Changing stable keys | Update other fields instead |

---

## 9. Appendix — Stamp Examples

Three complete examples showing progressively fuller use of the stamp grammar.

---

### 9.1 Simple — Lane + Title Only

Use when: registering quickly, topic not yet known.

```json
{
  "key": "RnHw:𝒯:noTopic一",
  "lane": "tw",
  "url": "http://localhost:8080/#SetAnchor",
  "title": "SetAnchor"
}
```

**Reading the key:** `RnHw` namespace → `𝒯` TiddlyWiki lane → `noTopic一` uncategorized, first entry.

---

### 9.2 Intermediate — Lane + Topic

Use when: topic is known, category not yet assigned.

# ContextLatticeStamp — Architecture Summary

**Version:** 0.1.0 | **Date:** 2026-02-23 | **Status:** Draft

---

## The Lattice — Horizontal Orientation

| | 𝒞 Claude | 𝒯 TiddlyWiki | 𝒦 Keep | 𝒮 SQL | ℱ FileSystem | 𝒢 GitHub | 𝒟 Docs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Category** | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell |
| **Topic** | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell | cell |

Lanes = columns. Categories/Topics = rows. Symbols are compact cell values — English labels are column headers.

## Key Grammar

```
RnHw : {Lane} : {Category}{Topic}{Qualifier}
 │        │         │        │       │
 │        │         │        │       └─ Disambiguator (optional)
 │        │         │        └─ Subject domain (Blackboard bold or plain)
 │        │         └─ Grouping (Fraktur, emerges from usage)
 │        └─ Platform (Script font: 𝒞𝒯𝒦𝒮ℱ𝒢𝒟)
 └─ Namespace (always RnHw)

## Storage — Scale Triggers

| Stage | Store | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| Now | JSON flat file | < 5,000 notes / < 5MB |
| Next | SQLite | > 5,000 notes or queries needed |
| Later | 3-Tier (HOT/WARM/COLD) | TW > 10,000 tiddlers |

## Core Design Principles

**Denser is better** — compressed stamps beat verbose re-explanation.  
**Symbols are vertical** — short chars for top-to-bottom scanning.  
**English is horizontal** — full labels work as column headers in tables.  
**Emerge, don't plan** — categories and topics reveal themselves from usage.  
**LatticeValue** — a shared version stamp across all docs, enabling drift detection.
